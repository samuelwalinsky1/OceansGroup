  <B>The Past:</B>
  <BR><BR>
   The Inuit of the historical era have largely been dependent on mammals for warm clothing. They killed Caribou when 
   their new hair was still short and fine, and provided the most popular clothing skins. Musk ox robes and skins of 
   caribou were used for bedding.

  <B>The Inuit:</B>
  <BR><BR>
  The Inuit are the native cultures that continue to live on coastal areas of Arctic tundra in Canada, Alaska, Siberia, 
  and Greenland. Inuit traditionally hunted for seals, whales, polar bears, caribou, birds and other animals from the 
  ocean and the tundra. Inuit people invented the kayak and used these small boats to hunt for Arctic marine animals. 
  Because of a great respect for these animals, Inuit have traditional customs that must be followed during a hunt.

   <B>The Cultural Landscape:</B>
  <BR><BR>
   Arctic residents have developed vocabularies for many local ice forms and processes. They call the ice their ‘winter 
   highway’ and populate it with hundreds of local place names, terms, trails, and navigation marks, along with stories 
   and ideas. Different kinds of ice that are indistinguishable to people living outside the Arctic have their specific 
   names, and the Inuit people of the North Alaska-Bering Strait have more than a hundred words for different types of sea 
   ice and ice processes. Arctic indigenous people are deeply familiar with their icescapes. They have transmitted their 
   age-old knowledge of sea ice via stories, careful training, and generations of shared experiences.

<B>Now:</B>

Humans in the Arctic have become more vulnerable to coastal erosion and face having to relocate their communities away 
from coastlines.
