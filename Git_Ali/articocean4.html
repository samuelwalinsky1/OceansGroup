    Early Harvesting From The Sea:
  <BR>
    The early Arctic explorers were drawn to the great abundance of seals and whales in the Artic, 
    and began to hunt the valuable animals. Their hunting became so intense that some species were driven nearly to extinction, 
    and sealing and whaling slowed down only when there were too few left to make the hunts profitable. Agreements among 
    nations now protect most seals and whales limiting how many can be killed.
