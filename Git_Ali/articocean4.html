The Artic is not a barren wasteland of snow and ice. There is lots of life thriving in the cold temperatures. 
Ringed seal and bearded seal are the most important aspect of an Inuit diet and is often the largest part of an 
Inuit hunter's diet. Land mammals such as caribou, polar bear, muskox, birds and their eggs are also a huge part of 
their diet. In addition, saltwater and freshwater fish including sculpin, Arctic cod, Arctic char, capelin and lake 
trout are also included.
