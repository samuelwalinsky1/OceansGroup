The Arctic region endures some of the greatest extremes: extreme cold, seasonal changes in daylight, and winds. 
The Arctic Ocean is home to numerous fish, mammals, and birds. Due to the ice coverage on the Arctic Ocean, its animal 
inhabitants have adapted to be skilled both on ice and in open water.

  <B>Animals:</B>
  <BR><BR>
There are many animals that are located in the Artic Ocean; for example: polar bears, walruses, narwhals, 
ringed seals, seabirds, etic. 
  <BR><BR>
<i>Polar Bears:</i>
  <BR>
 Polar bears are one of the most well known species that reside in the Arctic Ocean ecosystem. They are the largest 
 terrestrial mammalian carnivore species. The bears are born on land, however they spend most of their life on 
 sea ice. Polar bears primary food source are seals that come up from the ocean through holes in the ice to breathe. 
 As sea ice has been declining over the past decades, so too have polar bear population numbers. Because of the decreasing 
 sea ice, polar bears are currently listed as a threatened under the Endangered Species Act. 
  <BR>
<i>Walruses:</i>
  <BR>
Walruses spend much of their time in the more shallow waters of the Arctic Ocean looking for mollusks to eat. 
Walruses are covered in a thick layer of skin and blubber that keeps them insolated in the arctic temperatures. Walruses 
only have two natural predators: the polar bear and the killer whale. These large mammals are often considered a keystone 
species of the Arctic by scientists.

    How The Animals Are Impacted:
  <BR><BR>
   Ice-dependent species like polar bears and reindeer will experience a population decline as their food options disappear. 
   Thawing permafrost has led to more wildfires and affected infrastructure, while rising ocean temperatures and 
   acidification have already altered marine fisheries.
   <BR><BR>
   There have also been restrictions by the US on the import of sea mammal products; imposition by the International 
   Whaling Commission of quotas on the take of bowheads by Alaskan native hunters; signing of an international convention 
   on the conservation of the polar bear (particularly on the high seas) by the US, Norway, Denmark, the former USSR and 
   Canada; and the devolution of game management authority to Canadian Inuit organizations after land claim settlements.

What We Can Do:
<BR><BR>
• There is a lot that can be done around the world to slow the loss of Arctic sea ice. We can reduce our carbon 
emissions and dependence on fossil fuels.
<BR><BR>
• We can also take a more active role in preserving the Arctic from thousands of miles away by conserving other 
natural resources that have global impacts.
