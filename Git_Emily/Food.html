<p> Food is important to staying alive anywhere on the earth, and this doesnt change by and in the ocean!<BR> 
The Indian Ocean has food sources for all of the animals living in it, but humans fish and harvest from the ocean too.
Here is a source talking more about the  <a href="https://www.stimson.org/2013/under-sea-natural-resources-indian-ocean-0/">natural resources
we harvest from this ocean.</a></p>

<p> <b>The Food Web of the Indian Ocean</b><BR>
Trying to track every relationship between what plants and animals eat is nearly impossible, but we can categorize them!
On the lowest level there are producers like algae, seagrass, seaweed, and plankton. On the next level there is eel, dugong, clown 
anenome fish, and sea otters. At the top level there are killer whales, whale sharks, giant squid, sea turtles, and bottlenose dolphins.

<p> <b> Food and Climate</b>
Like many things, multiple aspects of the ocean are interrelated. The warming of the ocean is also killing animals, and therefore changing
what fishermen bring ashore for people tp buy in the stores. This graph to the right shows the changes in these rates over the years.

<p align=right>Food is important to humans, but it is not so important that they have to ruin other species living areas in order to
get food. Our constant desire to fish, harvest, and experience other species ecosystems can be harmful, or it can be educational.One
small example is the practice of fishing. Fishing is awesome, fun, and rewarding, but can also kill fish and hurt the food chain. A practice
to learn is catch and release, even in the Indian Ocean. Here is an article on how to safely
