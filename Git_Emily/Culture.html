<p align=right> Culture is different all around the world! We should take time to understand it no matter where it is.
The Indian Ocean is located between Africa and Austral-Asia and the Southern Ocean. There are many popular islands, including places 
like Mauritius, Seychelles, Reunion, Madagascar, Maldives, and Sri Lanka. These places all have unique practices and culture.

<p> <b> Waterways</b><BR>
Places for water and ships to pass are essential for smaller communities throughout this huge ocean. The Suez Canal in Egypt, and the Strait of
Malacca between Malaysia and Indonesia are the two most well known waterways in the Indian Ocean. A photo of the Suez is provided below.
There are also many major ports, like Singapore with the busiest container port on the Indian Ocean, Mumbai and Chennai ports in India, 
and Durban (South Africa), with the largest/busiest port in Africa.

<p> <b> Jobs in the Indian Ocean </b><BR> <BR>
The Indian Ocean provides a large percentage of oil for the world, meaning it produces a lot of jobs for workers there.
It is estimated that approximately 40% of the world's oil comes from the Indian Ocean.</p>

Here is an interesting, more scholarly source talking about the
<a href="https://westerlymag.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/WesterlyVol.29no.4.7-18.pdf">culture. 
The Indian Ocean is one that is often overlooked and forgotten, but in reality it is a huge part of the 
world with unique parts to it.
