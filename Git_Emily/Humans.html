<div>
<p> Humans are slowly destroying the planet, and this is something that is super evident in the ocean.<BR> 
The Indian Ocean has so many different aspects that we are ruining before we even know what they are. 
Here is a source talking more about the  <a href="http://www.cemexnature.com/excerpt/the-human-impact-expands-in-the-indian-ocean/">
Human Effects </a><BR>
Some other human related ideas that are often forgotten are the idea that fishing is not an inexhaustible resource, and overfishing can damage
the natural resources. Even when people fish and release, they are often too exhausted or injured and end up dying anyways.
Trash can be deadly to animals, they cannot digest what they eat, and often get stuck in debris. Excess of trash in landfills and
	littering leads to an incredible amount of trash in the sea water.

<p><b> Climate change due to human interaction </b><BR> <BR>
Humans have come to understand their actions and how it has such a big effect on this world around us that we are living in. A place we 
notice this is in the ocean with rising temperatures, rising sea levels, increasing acidification and so much more that we still do not
understand. Our actions in warming the ocean temperature have detrimental effect on plant and animal life. Coral is dying due to our actions.
Coral is a part of an even bigger web of life, and it removes homes for so many other plants and animals too.

<p align=right> Actions by humans can lead to things like natural disasters or tsunamis. Human actions relating
to climate change and ocean warming are not good for the future of the ocean. Tsunamis are even more destructive and 
travel further as the ocean is rising. To the left there is a photo showing the utter destruction involved when a city
is struck by a tsunami. Coastal development also ruins natural storm protection with natural protection of sand dunes.
