	<b>Here is some information about Animals</b> <BR>
Animals in the ocean are abundant, and there is quite a variety of them. Scientists do not even know of all the animals
that exist throughout the ocean. Some well known animals in the indian ocean are  blue whales, dolphins, great white sharks, green sea turtles,
humpback whales, seahorse, dugongs (also reffered to as an ocean cow), and sperm whales.
More information on these animals<a href="http://www.facts-about.info/tag/indian-ocean-animals/"> here </a>

	<p> <b>Some animals or plants in the Indian Ocean are more dangerous than others..</b><BR> <BR>
What are these animals you may ask? They vary from the traditional great white sharks which have a reputation for being scary to box jellyfish 
to the more unknown Barringtonia asiatica. Barringtonia asiatica is a tree, which all parts are poisonous upon consumption. Small powder of this
plant can be enough to stun or even kill fish<BR><BR>
