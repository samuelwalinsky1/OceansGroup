<p><font size="5"> The Pacific has the most varied array of plants (algae) and animals of the world's oceans. The circumglobal mixing of water in the southern and, to a much more limited extent, northern polar reaches of the Pacific permits the intermingling of flora and fauna from other oceanic regions, while temperate and tropical surface waters of the Pacific are more likely to have indigenous biotas.

On the rocky cold-water coasts of North and South America are huge kelp forest beds made up of brown algae of the genus Laminaria, with individual plants often reaching heights of 100 feet (30 metres) or more. They harbour a rich animal complement of invertebrates and fishes approaching a faunal variety that vies with that of tropical rainforests. Where upwelling and other current conditions add nutrients to the offshore surface waters of these same reaches of the Pacific, dense concentrations of plankton-feeding fishes thrive, predominantly those of the herring family and its relatives. Examples include the Japanese sardine and the Peruvian anchovy, both of which are among the largest single-species fishing catches in the world.

In the North Pacific the circulation patterns and runoff from the land create conditions in which demersal, or bottom-living, species are found. The North Pacific hake and the Alaska pollock are among the species that dwell there. Salmon likewise thrive in the North Pacific, proliferating there in five species of the genus Oncorhynchus, as compared with the single species, Salmo salar, of the Atlantic.

In the warm tropical region, roughly between the North and South Equatorial Current systems, the wealth of marine animals especially increases dramatically. The variety of animal life is greater in the western Pacific, where the warm monsoonal climate and variegated landforms have promoted evolution of the unique Indo-Pacific marine forms. The western Pacific also has the richest and most extensive coral reefs of any ocean, with some six times more species of fish associated with them than with the coral reefs of the Caribbean Sea in the Atlantic. The tropical sea passages between the Pacific and the Indian oceans have also given the latter ocean a rich reef fauna; Indo-Pacific mollusks have reached copious evolutionary diversification, with the giant clam, Tridacna gigas, a spectacular example.
