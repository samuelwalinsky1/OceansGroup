	Between the exploration of famed pilot Amelia Earhart, and the failed voyage of the 
	Titanic, the mythos regarding travel in the Atlantic is filled with stories of 
	success and failure and work to tell the story of the drive for pushing boundaries 
	that come with being human. In this page, I'll talk more about the in's and outs 
	regarding the failed voyage of the Titanic as well as Amelia Earhart's solo flight 
	across the Atlantic.

	<p>In the early 20th century, the Titanic aspired to be, for its time, the largest 
	passenger ocean-liner to cross the Atlantic. It was a gaudy 880 feet long and was 
	designed to provide rooms for well over two thousand passengers and crew members.
	Unfortunately, at the design stage, the executives behind the construction of the 
	Titanic decided to not bring enough lifeboats as they believed it would take away from
	the appearance of the boat. This resulted in tragedy, when the boat hit an iceberg 
	sinking the ship and killing fifteen hundred people.

	<p> Born in Atchison,Kansas, in 1897, Amelia Earhart became the first woman to cross the Atlantic 
	Ocean in a plane. Because of this feat, she was propelled to the status of national 
	hero. Earhart would make this flight again, this time without 
	a co-pilot, and once again set another aviation record becoming the first woman to
	fly across the Atlantic by herself.
