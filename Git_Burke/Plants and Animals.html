	The plants and animals of the Atlantic Ocean contribute to its vast biodiversity. The 3,000 known species that live here create a fascinating ecosystem like no other. In addition to microscopic phytoplankton, huge humpback whales, and everything in between, it is home to algae which has the power to be used as biofuel and move us toward a greener planet, and it holds a large number fish which help to feed the world.

	<p>  In order to grow, algae requires only carbon dioxide, sunshine, and running water. With such a simple recipe, this algae presents an extremely realistic and attainable alternative to fossil fuel. Algae fuel has the potential to uproot our current dependence on non renewable fossil fuels. After being processed into fuel, many scientists believe that the algae remains can also be used as food for livestock, lessening the need for deforestation and reducing crop run-off.

	<p> While the Atlantic ocean contains a diverse number of animals, the different fish species that live there have a particular impact on humans. The fishing industry of the Atlantic Ocean is responsible for employing 70,000 people in the central Atlantic region alone. The United States generates over 200 billion dollars a year through fishing, and since half of the world's fishing occurs in the Atlantic Ocean, it is a vital contributor to our economy.
